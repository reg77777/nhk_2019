Description: This is a smple rqt-based GUI for smach. It shows the state of
            hierarchical SMACH state machines. It can visualize the possible
            transitions between states, as well as the currently active state
            and the values of user data that is passed around between states.
            The smach viewer uses the SMACH debugging interface based on
            the <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/smach_msgs">smach
            messages</a> to gather information from running state machines.
